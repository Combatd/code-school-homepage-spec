# code-school-homepage-spec
A hypothetical homepage for an imaginary programming school.

In any project involving a web interface, it is important to be able to plan out web elements to be used. This is done with wireframing and developer documentation in the planning phase prior to writing a single line of code.

## Learning Goals
* Being able to discuss and plan your core elements allows your web page to have a solid foundation to build on.
* Using semantic HTML elements to be able easily target specific parts of the page to add styling and visual elements later on.
* Developing a design and development style of thinking rather than mindless code-writing.

## Essential HTML Elements for the webpage
1. Main Heading (h1)
2. Subheading (h2)
3. Main Image (img)
4. Text paragraphs (p)
5. Links (underlined blue text) (a)
6. Lists (ul, ol, li)
7. Sections (div)
8. Social media icons (identify what tag a social media icon is)
