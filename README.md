# code-school-homepage-spec
A hypothetical homepage for an imaginary programming school.

In any project involving a web interface, it is important to be able to plan out web elements to be used. This is done with wireframing and developer documentation in the planning phase prior to writing a single line of code.

## Learning Goals
* Being able to discuss and plan your core elements allows your web page to have a solid foundation to build on.
* Using semantic HTML elements to be able easily target specific parts of the page to add styling and visual elements later on.
* Developing a design and development style of thinking rather than mindless code-writing.

## Essential HTML Elements for the webpage
1. Main Heading (h1)
2. Subheading (h2)
3. Main Image (img)
4. Text paragraphs (p)
5. Links (underlined blue text) (a)
6. Lists (ul, ol, li)
7. Sections (div)
8. Social media icons (identify what tag a social media icon is)

## First stage - Putting elements on the page
At this point of my project, the high-level stuff should be complete. I will put the basic layout with a bunch of boilerplate text that I make up on the fly in my elements. I should focus on making sure that things are legible.

This means adding padding for the main body of content. I might need to set the width and height of a laptop image. All headings and lis should be labeled. so should all p elements. I should check the margins and paddings as I add these elements. We could probably rely on CSS Flex to do things if necessary, and align text to the center.
